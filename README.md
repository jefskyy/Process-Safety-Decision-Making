# Project Description

The chemical process industry seeks to mitigate safety incidents through protective barriers: design, hazard analyses, etc. This project supplements these efforts by improving process safety decision making pedagogy.

Humans are notorious for being poor predictors of their behaviors [CITE], including when we predict that we will make safe decisions. We are often poor predictors of our behaviors because of "behavioral forecasting" and "ethical fading". 

Behavioral forecasting is when you know you are being tested, so you seek out to make the "best" ethical decision possible. Ethical fading is when you are bombarded with stimuli and tasks that you lose track of the ethical importance of decisions that you're making.

When these two phenomena take place in the chemical process industry, engineers can make series of poor decisions that lead to process incidents. These incidents often have harsh implications on plant workers, nearby communities and the environment, so there is a need for engineers to practice making decisions to avoid these incidents.

This project meets this need through 2 sections: (1) evaluation with the Engineering Process Safety Research Instrument and (2) practice using the Contents Under Pressure digital game.
