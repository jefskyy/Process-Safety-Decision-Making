# Project Description

The chemical process industry seeks to mitigate safety incidents through protective barriers: design, hazard analyses, etc. This project supplements these efforts by improving process safety decision making pedagogy.

Humans are notorious for being poor predictors of their behaviors [CITE], including when we predict that we will make safe decisions. We are often poor predictors of our behaviors because of "behavioral forecasting" and "ethical fading". 

Behavioral forecasting is when you know you are being tested, so you seek out to make the "best" ethical decision possible. Ethical fading is when you are bombarded with stimuli and tasks that you lose track of the ethical importance of decisions that you're making.

When these two phenomena take place in the chemical process industry, engineers can make series of poor decisions that lead to process incidents. These incidents often have harsh implications on plant workers, nearby communities and the environment, so there is a need for evaluation of such decisions.

This site documents a tool dedicated to evaluating the moral reaosning of process safety decisions, the Engineering Process Safety Research Instrument (EPSRI).

# The Engineering Process Safety Research Instrument (EPSRI)
 
The EPSRI can assess moral reasoning of respondents based on how they respond to to five hypothetical ethical dilemmas. Specifically, respondents must rate and rank a series of considerations towards a decision they make in the dilemma. The EPSRI has undergone instrument validation among senior undergraduate chemical engineering students from three US institutions. This means we have tested the EPSRI for its validity (that it reports moral reasoning) and reliability (that it reports this consistently). The exact process the EPSRI followed is documented in our publications [1, 2].

 The EPSRI has been prepared as a Qualtrics survey and Microsoft Word document([EPSRI Distributable](https://github.com/jefskyy/Process-Safety-Decision-Making/tree/main/EPSRI%20Distributable)) to be applied in classrooms or research studies.

# Obtaining Scores from the EPSRI

There are four results we recommend pulling out of the EPSRI: P score, N2 Score, Predominant Reasoning level, and CDIT score. However, before calculating these scores, it is important to clean the data for unreliable results. The following sub-sections describe these steps. Also, an example spreadsheet (Microsoft Excel) has been prepared to walk us through each of the steps in data filtering and in obtaining scores, here.

## Data Filtering
Data filtering consists of three filters: missing data, repeating data, and the rate-rank score. Repeating and missing data are easily obtained in the provided spreadsheet. However, the rate-rank score can be solved manually, and instructions on how to do so are provided below. Alternatively, and the preferred method, is to use the provided  MATLAB script. If you do not have access to MATLAB, other languages may be used, but have not been developed.
