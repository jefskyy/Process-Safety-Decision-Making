One of the manufacturing processes in your facility requires transporting a dangerous chemical which is fatal to humans upon exposure through metal hoses lined with polymer. You must choose the hose used to carry this dangerous chemical, and you find there are two options for these hoses: Option A is a hose lined with a polymer that slowly breaks down upon exposure to the chemical - it is fairly inexpensive, but would need to be replaced on a monthly basis to avoid leaks and\/or accidental sudden discharge of the chemical in the facility. Each monthly replacement of the Option A hose brings with it elevated risk of exposure to the fatal chemical, but maintenance procedures are in place to minimize the risk under normal conditions. Option B has a more expensive polymer liner which offers greater resistance to attack by the chemical, and so the hose would only need to be replaced each year. You determine that it would be more expensive to specify Option B on an annual basis, while Option A would offer savings with a similar level of safety under normal operation. You receive a $5,000 bonus for each year that you keep equipment costs below a certain level, and you are currently projected to spend above this threshold level - specifying Option A would go a long way toward producing the savings needed to receive your bonus. <br><br>Which hose would you

The temperature control on these tanks is important, since at elevated temperatures, the increased volatility may pose a risk of tank over pressurization or even explosion. Today, the National Weather Service announced that their models are predicting a severe hurricane that has a significant probability of impacting the region where your plant is situated. While you are confident that the plant has been designed to withstand the appropriate wind loads, this particular storm is predicted to bring about unprecedented flooding, which you are not certain the plant has been designed to tolerate. The temperature control loops and associated equipment are connected to backup generators in the event of a power failure, but the generators themselves will fail if exposed to floodwaters, leaving the tanks uncontrolled. The effects of a release of the volatile material are largely unknown, especially under storm conditions, and an explosion, depending on the magnitude, could cripple or destroy the plant. The storm is still several days away, giving you some time to reach a decision on a course of action.<br><br>What should you do? <br>","QuestionType":"MC","Selector":"SAVR","SubSelector":"TX","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"You are an engineer at a chemical company that produces chemical additives for the gasoline indus...","Choices":{"1":{"Display":"Option A - Take no action and hope potential flooding will not compromise the generators"},"2":{"Display":"Can\u2019t decide on a course of action"},"3":{"Display":"Option B - Solicit volunteers to stay through the storm and attempt to keep the generators functioning"}},"ChoiceOrder":[1,2,3],"Validation":{"Settings":{"ForceResponse":"OFF","Type":"None"}},"Language":[],"NextChoiceId":4,"NextAnswerId":1,"QuestionText_Unsafe":"Click to write the question text","DataExportTag":"Q7","QuestionID":"QID7","DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false}}},{"SurveyID":"SV_bedV543Zqu5yUZw","Element":"SQ","PrimaryAttribute":"QID11","SecondaryAttribute":"You are an engineer who has just been hired by a start-up company that makes personal care produc...","TertiaryAttribute":null,"Payload":{"QuestionText":"You are an engineer who has just been hired by a start-up company that makes personal care products for your first job out of college.

Through the product\u2019s development, the process has become reliant on a chemical additive that significantly improves the reaction rate of your primary reaction. The additive has catalytic properties which shortens overall reaction time and thus increases production. Over the years, there have been a number of studies and reports that implicate this additive in a variety of potentially harmful outcomes, both environmental and personal health related. Though you and your coworkers observe all appropriate chemical hygiene protocols regarding the additive, you are all regularly exposed to it in the course of your work. Because of the chemical nature of the additive, it does not readily break down in nature or in biological systems, and as such, it has been found in the environment in places not normally expected, including in water sources and wildlife, where negative consequences are predicted but still unconfirmed. As such, the Environmental Protection Agency has not taken any action or issued any concrete guidelines on the continued use of this additive. Your company is small, and so the total volume of this additive you use on a yearly basis is also small - significantly smaller than in other processes where it might be used. Additionally, without an obvious replacement, internal data shows that your product throughput would decline substantially were you to phase out your usage of the additive. Your supervisor has asked you to look at the latest data and make some recommendations for the future of this process while production continues, and would like that recommendation within the month.<br><br>What should you do?<br>","QuestionType":"MC","Selector":"SAVR","SubSelector":"TX","Configuration":{"QuestionDescriptionOption":"UseText"},"QuestionDescription":"You are working in the R&D department of a small chemical company that produces specialty coating...","Choices":{"1":{"Display":"Option A - Spend the month looking for alternative chemistries that may work in your existing process to replace the current additive"},"2":{"Display":"Can\u2019t decide on a course of action"},"3":{"Display":"Option B - Decide that your usage volume and the ambiguity of the data on the consequences of exposure do not warrant any changes to your process at this time"}},"ChoiceOrder":["1","2","3"],"Validation":{"Settings":{"ForceResponse":"OFF","Type":"None"}},"Language":[],"NextChoiceId":4,"NextAnswerId":1,"QuestionText_Unsafe":"Click to write the question text","DataExportTag":"Q14","QuestionID":"QID14","DataVisibility":{"Private":false,"Hidden":false}}}]}
